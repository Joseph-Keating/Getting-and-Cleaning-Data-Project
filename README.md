### Introduction

This repo tidies and summarizes the data taken from measurements made on 30 volunteers wearing the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The background to the data is given at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The script run_analysis.R;

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The Codebook.md file describes the variables in the tidy file and in the summary file
